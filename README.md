# test_automation_interview

This is the repo for test automation candidates to use during the technical
interview.

There are two folders here.
- The first, `simple-todo-app`, contains the app that will be tested (the SUT).
- The second, `robot-tests`, contains the test code that will be run against
  the app.

In both cases, see their respective README files for details.
